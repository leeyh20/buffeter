<h1>MILESTONE 1</h1>

<h2>Scope of Project</h2>
<p>Buffeter is an app that allows users to search for buffets and latest buffet deals available in Singapore. It also allows users to give reviews and suggest new buffet restaurants. </p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Food lovers, buffet lovers in particular</p>

<h2>Level of Achievement</h2>
<p>Project Gemini</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ever felt frustrated that food apps such as HungryGoWhere and Burpple are cluttered with all kinds of food reviews? Or irritated by the difficulty of finding reviews just about the buffets in restaurants? Unaware of the various buffet promotions that is available? This is what our webapp will solve - it is simple, user-driven and buffet-specific.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>User-driven but not contributing to spam or giving inaccurate info</li>
  <li>Easy to use, easy to find (popular) buffets</li>
  <li>Provide ways for user to contribute constructive reviews (with pictures) and reward them as an incentive</li>
</ol>

<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>We aim to build a web-app. We are considering technologies such as AngularJS, PHP / MySql for database, and Parse to work along with it.</p>

<h2>How is it Useful</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that Buffeter can come in handy</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facilitate buffet outings</li>
  <li>Discover new and popular buffet restaurants</li>
  <li>In the buffet restaurant's perspective, help better buffet restaurants to be promoted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features/ User Stories</h2>
<ol>
  <li>As a user who is looking for buffet restaurants, I need to be able to search for buffet restaurants. To do this, the web app should allow me to search for buffet restaurants and filter the results by price, location, type of cuisine, promotions available etc.</li>
  <li>As a user who wants to review a buffet restaurant, I need to be able to submit reviews. To do this, the web app should allow me to create, update and delete my reviews.</li>
  <li>As a user who wants to suggest a new buffet restaurant, I need to be able to submit my suggestions. To do this, the web app should allow me to create, update and delete my suggestions.</li>
  <li>As a user who wants to tell a friend about the buffet restaurant, I need to be able to share the information through social media. To do this, the web app should allow me to share information about the buffet with my friends on Facebook, Whatsapp etc.</li>

</ol>
<p>For the next sprint, we will do features 1, 2 and 3. We will save feature 4 and other fixes that the peer teams suggest in July during sprint 3.</p>

We would improve on features 1 to 3 too, by allowing the uploading of photos, having a better user profile and better user interface suited for mobile. Users should have points and a profile page. We should also make it easier to add buffets, with locations linked to Google Map (extensions!) </p>

<h2>List Of Technologies Learned/Applied In The Project</h2>

<p>- Django
<br>- Regex expressions
<br>- Python / PIP
<br>- Bootstrap and Jquery
<br>- HTML
<br>- CSS
<br>- Github
<br>- Sqlite / SQL
</p>


<h2>User Testing</h2>
<p> <b> Expert/ Self Evaluation </b>
<br>
Our mentor commented that the search was good. Suggested us to add photos to buffets on the homepage. He also suggested to add the number of buffets in the different filters on the drop-down box and to make search terms clearer while searching. 
Overall, he felt the app could have more of a "wow" factor if we had a main selling point. We wanted to focus on promotions, so we added a promotions page. If we had more time, we would like to do a review voting system and user reward system for giving good reviews and suggesting good buffets.</p> 

<p> <b> User Stories </b>
<br> We believe that we have fulfilled all the user stories :)
</p>

<p> <b> Usability Testing with Potential Users with High-Fidelity artefacts </b>
<br> Though our live and deployed app, we asked our friends aged 20 to 23 to try out our app. One commented that the mobile version looked lacking compared to the desktop version. Another commented that she could imagine using the app
especially if there are enticing promotions on the site.
</p>

<h2> Future ideas </h2>
<p> Active users can even be rewarded with real discounts such that more people will help to update the buffets on the site. Plus, it could promote certain restaurants and buffets (commercial value)
